                    <p class="text-secondary">Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions or inferences about a population based on sample data. It provides a framework for determining whether observed differences between samples, or between a sample and a theoretical value, are statistically significant or merely due to random chance.</p>
                    
                    <p>The main components of hypothesis testing include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Formulating null and alternative hypotheses</li>
                        <li>Selecting an appropriate test statistic</li>
                        <li>Establishing a significance level</li>
                        <li>Computing the test statistic from sample data</li>
                        <li>Making a decision based on the p-value or critical region</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="text-secondary">Hypothesis testing is widely used across various fields, including science, medicine, economics, and social sciences, to draw conclusions about populations based on sample evidence.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Null and Alternative Hypotheses</h3>
                    
                    <p>The first step in hypothesis testing is formulating the hypotheses:</p>
                    
                    <h4>Null Hypothesis (H₀)</h4>
                    <p>The null hypothesis represents the status quo or the "no effect" scenario. It is a specific statement about a population parameter that is assumed to be true until evidence suggests otherwise. Typically, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference, no effect, or no relationship.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Hₐ)</h4>
                    <p>The alternative hypothesis is the claim or statement that contradicts the null hypothesis. It represents what the researcher is trying to establish or prove.</p>
                    
                    <p>Alternative hypotheses can be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Two-tailed</strong>: The parameter differs from the value specified in H₀ (≠)</li>
                        <li><strong>Right-tailed</strong>: The parameter is greater than the value specified in H₀ (>)</li>
                        <li><strong>Left-tailed</strong>: The parameter is less than the value specified in H₀ (<)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example 1: Formulating Hypotheses</div>
                        <p>A company claims that the mean lifetime of its light bulbs is at least 1000 hours. A researcher wants to test this claim.</p>
                        <p><strong>Null Hypothesis (H₀)</strong>: μ ≥ 1000 hours (The mean lifetime is at least 1000 hours)</p>
                        <p><strong>Alternative Hypothesis (H₁)</strong>: μ < 1000 hours (The mean lifetime is less than 1000 hours)</p>
                        <p>This is a left-tailed test because we're testing if the mean is less than the claimed value.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Types of Errors and Power</h3>
                    
                    <p>When making decisions in hypothesis testing, two types of errors can occur:</p>
                    
                    <h4>Type I Error (False Positive)</h4>
                    <p>A Type I error occurs when we reject a null hypothesis that is actually true. The probability of a Type I error is denoted by α, which is also called the significance level of the test.</p>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        α = P(Reject H₀ | H₀ is true)
                    </div>
                    
                    <h4>Type II Error (False Negative)</h4>
                    <p>A Type II error occurs when we fail to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false. The probability of a Type II error is denoted by β.</p>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        β = P(Fail to reject H₀ | H₀ is false)
                    </div>
                    
                    <h4>Power of a Test</h4>
                    <p>The power of a statistical test is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis. It is equal to 1 - β.</p>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        Power = 1 - β = P(Reject H₀ | H₀ is false)
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>Factors affecting the power of a test include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sample size (larger samples increase power)</li>
                        <li>Effect size (larger effects are easier to detect)</li>
                        <li>Significance level (higher α increases power but also increases Type I error risk)</li>
                        <li>Variability in the data (less variability increases power)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example 2: Understanding Type I and Type II Errors</div>
                        <p>Consider a court trial where:</p>
                        <p>H₀: The defendant is innocent</p>
                        <p>H₁: The defendant is guilty</p>
                        <p><strong>Type I Error</strong>: Convicting an innocent person (rejecting a true null hypothesis)</p>
                        <p><strong>Type II Error</strong>: Acquitting a guilty person (failing to reject a false null hypothesis)</p>
                        <p>The legal system typically sets a high burden of proof ("beyond reasonable doubt") to minimize Type I errors, accepting a higher risk of Type II errors as a trade-off.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Steps in Hypothesis Testing</h3>
                    
                    <p>The hypothesis testing procedure follows a structured approach:</p>
                    
                    <h4>1. State the Hypotheses</h4>
                    <p>Clearly define the null hypothesis (H₀) and alternative hypothesis (H₁) based on the research question.</p>
                    
                    <h4>2. Determine the Significance Level (α)</h4>
                    <p>Set the threshold probability for rejecting the null hypothesis. Common values are 0.05, 0.01, and 0.10.</p>
                    
                    <h4>3. Select the Appropriate Test Statistic</h4>
                    <p>Choose a test statistic based on the parameter being tested and the sampling distribution (e.g., z-test, t-test, F-test, chi-square test).</p>
                    
                    <h4>4. Establish the Critical Region or p-value Approach</h4>
                    <p>Determine the values of the test statistic that would lead to rejection of the null hypothesis:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Critical Region Approach</strong>: Define the critical values that separate the rejection and non-rejection regions.</li>
                        <li><strong>p-value Approach</strong>: Calculate the p-value, which is the probability of observing a test statistic as extreme as or more extreme than the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>5. Collect Sample Data and Calculate the Test Statistic</h4>
                    <p>Gather data from the sample and compute the value of the test statistic.</p>
                    
                    <h4>6. Make a Decision</h4>
                    <p>Based on the critical region or p-value approach:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the test statistic falls in the critical region (or p-value < α), reject H₀</li>
                        <li>If the test statistic does not fall in the critical region (or p-value ≥ α), fail to reject H₀</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>7. Interpret the Results</h4>
                    <p>Explain the decision in the context of the original research question, acknowledging the possibility of Type I or Type II errors.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example 3: Hypothesis Testing Procedure</div>
                        <p>A researcher claims that the mean weight of adult male penguins is different from 18 kg. A random sample of 30 penguins has a mean weight of 17.2 kg with a standard deviation of 2.5 kg.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> H₀: μ = 18 kg, H₁: μ ≠ 18 kg (two-tailed test)</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Let's use α = 0.05</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Use a t-test since we have a small sample and don't know the population standard deviation:</p>
                        <div class="math-formula">
                            t = (x̄ - μ) / (s/√n)
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> For α = 0.05 and df = 29, the critical values are t = ±2.045</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Calculate the test statistic:</p>
                        <div class="math-formula">
                            t = (17.2 - 18) / (2.5/√30) = -0.8/0.456 = -1.75
                        </div>
                        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Since -1.75 > -2.045, the test statistic does not fall in the critical region. We fail to reject H₀.</p>
                        <p><strong>Step 7:</strong> There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the mean weight of adult male penguins differs from 18 kg.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">p-Values and Statistical Significance</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Understanding p-Values</h4>
                    <p>The p-value is the probability of obtaining a test statistic at least as extreme as the one observed, assuming the null hypothesis is true. It represents the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-secondary">Key points about p-values:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A smaller p-value indicates stronger evidence against H₀</li>
                        <li>The p-value is not the probability that H₀ is true</li>
                        <li>The p-value is not the probability of making a Type I error</li>
                        <li>The p-value depends on both the observed effect size and the sample size</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Statistical Significance</h4>
                    <p>A result is statistically significant if the p-value is less than the chosen significance level (α). This indicates that the observed effect is unlikely to have occurred by chance alone if the null hypothesis is true.</p>
                    
                    <p>Common misinterpretations to avoid:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Statistical significance does not necessarily imply practical importance</li>
                        <li>Failure to reject H₀ does not prove that H₀ is true</li>
                        <li>A very small p-value does not guarantee a large effect size</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example 5: Interpreting p-Values</div>
                        <p>A study tests whether a new weight loss program is effective. The null hypothesis is that the mean weight loss is zero.</p>
                        <p>Scenario A: p-value = 0.002</p>
                        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> There is strong evidence against the null hypothesis. The probability of observing such weight loss (or more extreme) by chance if the program had no effect is only 0.2%. We reject H₀ and conclude the program is effective.</p>
                        
                        <p>Scenario B: p-value = 0.08</p>
                        <p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> There is moderate evidence against the null hypothesis, but not enough to reject it at the α = 0.05 level. The probability of observing such weight loss (or more extreme) by chance if the program had no effect is 8%. We fail to reject H₀, but further investigation may be warranted.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Assumptions and Limitations</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Common Assumptions in Hypothesis Testing</h4>
                    <p>Most parametric tests rely on specific assumptions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Independence</strong>: Observations within and between samples are independent</li>
                        <li><strong>Normality</strong>: The data (or differences, or residuals) follow a normal distribution</li>
                        <li><strong>Homogeneity of Variance</strong>: Variances across groups are approximately equal (for tests comparing multiple groups)</li>
                        <li><strong>Random Sampling</strong>: Samples are randomly selected from the population</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Limitations and Potential Pitfalls</h4>
                    <p>Despite its usefulness, hypothesis testing has several limitations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Dichotomous Decision Making</strong>: The reject/fail to reject framework may oversimplify complex realities</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple Testing Problem</strong>: Conducting many tests increases the risk of false positives</li>
                        <li><strong>p-Hacking</strong>: Manipulating analyses until significant results appear</li>
                        <li><strong>Publication Bias</strong>: Studies with significant results are more likely to be published</li>
                        <li><strong>Overemphasis on Statistical Significance</strong>: Focus on p-values at the expense of effect sizes and practical importance</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Addressing Limitations</h4>
                    <p>Several approaches can help address these limitations:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Effect Size Reporting</strong>: Report and interpret measures of effect size alongside p-values</li>
                        <li><strong>Confidence Intervals</strong>: Provide interval estimates rather than just point estimates</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple Comparison Corrections</strong>: Use methods like Bonferroni or False Discovery Rate to adjust for multiple testing</li>
                        <li><strong>Pre-registration</strong>: Specify hypotheses and analysis plans before collecting data</li>
                        <li><strong>Replication</strong>: Confirm findings through independent replication studies</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example 6: Checking Assumptions</div>
                        <p>Before conducting a two-sample t-test to compare mean exam scores between two teaching methods, a researcher should check:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Independence</strong>: Ensure students in each group do not influence each other</li>
                            <li><strong>Normality</strong>: Check if exam scores in each group approximately follow a normal distribution (using histograms, Q-Q plots, or formal tests like Shapiro-Wilk)</li>
                            <li><strong>Homogeneity of Variance</strong>: Verify that score variances are similar between groups (using Levene's test or F-test)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>If these assumptions are violated, the researcher might consider:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Transforming the data to achieve normality</li>
                            <li>Using a non-parametric alternative like the Mann-Whitney U test</li>
                            <li>Using Welch's t-test, which does not assume equal variances</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>A pharmaceutical company has developed a new medication intended to lower cholesterol levels. They conduct a randomized controlled trial with 200 patients, half receiving the new drug and half receiving a placebo.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Research Question</strong>: Does the new medication significantly reduce cholesterol levels compared to a placebo?</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Hypotheses</strong>:</p>
                        <p>H₀: μ₁ = μ₂ (Mean cholesterol reduction is the same for the drug and placebo)</p>
                        <p>H₁: μ₁ > μ₂ (Mean cholesterol reduction is greater for the drug than the placebo)</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Test</strong>: Independent two-sample t-test (one-tailed)</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Results</strong>:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Drug group: Mean reduction = 28.5 mg/dL, SD = 12.2 mg/dL</li>
                            <li>Placebo group: Mean reduction = 5.3 mg/dL, SD = 11.8 mg/dL</li>
                            <li>t-statistic = 13.67, p-value < 0.0001</li>

                        <p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The extremely small p-value provides strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis. The medication appears to significantly reduce cholesterol levels compared to the placebo. The mean difference of 23.2 mg/dL is also clinically significant.</p>
