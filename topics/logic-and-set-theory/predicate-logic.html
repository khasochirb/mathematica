                    <h3 class="topic-header">Introduction to Predicate Logic</h3>
                    
                    <p class="text-secondary">Predicate logic, also known as first-order logic, is a powerful extension of propositional logic that allows us to express more complex statements and relationships. While propositional logic deals with simple statements that are either true or false, predicate logic introduces variables, quantifiers, and predicates to express properties of objects and relationships between them.</p>
                    
                    <p>This enhanced expressiveness makes predicate logic an essential foundation for mathematics, computer science, linguistics, and philosophy. It provides the formal framework necessary for precisely stating mathematical theorems, defining mathematical structures, and constructing rigorous proofs.</p>
                    
                    <h4>From Propositional to Predicate Logic</h4>
                    <p>Consider the following statements:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"All natural numbers are positive."</li>
                        <li>"Some integers are negative."</li>
                        <li>"If a number is prime, then it has exactly two distinct divisors."</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Propositional logic can't adequately represent these statements because they involve properties that apply to collections of objects, and relationships between different properties. Predicate logic adds the necessary tools to formalize such statements.</p>

                <div class="topic-section edu-card">
                    <h3 class="topic-header">Predicates and Quantifiers</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Predicates</h4>
                    <p>A predicate is a statement that contains variables and becomes a proposition when specific values are assigned to those variables. Predicates are typically denoted by capital letters, with variables as arguments.</p>
                    
                    <p>For example, let P(x) represent "x is a prime number" where x is a variable that can be any integer. Then:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>P(2) is true (2 is prime)</li>
                        <li>P(4) is false (4 is not prime)</li>
                        <li>P(7) is true (7 is prime)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>We can also have predicates with multiple variables. Let R(x, y) represent "x is greater than y". Then:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>R(5, 3) is true (5 > 3)</li>
                        <li>R(2, 7) is false (2 is not > 7)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Quantifiers</h4>
                    <p>Quantifiers allow us to express statements about collections of objects. The two main quantifiers are:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Universal Quantifier (∀):</strong> "For all" or "For every"<br>
                    <strong>Existential Quantifier (∃):</strong> "There exists" or "For some"</p>
                    
                    <p>Using our previous examples:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"All natural numbers are positive" can be written as: ∀x(N(x) → P(x))<br>
                        where N(x) means "x is a natural number" and P(x) means "x is positive".</li>
                        <li>"Some integers are negative" can be written as: ∃x(I(x) ∧ N(x))<br>
                        where I(x) means "x is an integer" and N(x) means "x is negative".</li>
                    </ul>

                        <div class="example-title">Example: Translating Between English and Predicate Logic</div>
                        <p>Let's translate the following statements to and from predicate logic:</p>
                        <p>1. "Every prime number greater than 2 is odd."</p>
                        <p>Let P(x) mean "x is prime", G(x, y) mean "x is greater than y", and O(x) mean "x is odd".</p>
                        <p>Translation: ∀x((P(x) ∧ G(x, 2)) → O(x))</p>
                        <p>2. ∃x(S(x) ∧ ∀y(S(y) → (x ≤ y)))</p>
                        <p>Let S(x) mean "x is a student" and ≤ represent "is younger than or the same age as".</p>
                        <p>Translation: "There exists a student who is younger than or the same age as all other students."</p>
                        <p>In other words, "There is a youngest student."</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Formal Syntax and Semantics</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Syntax of Predicate Logic</h4>
                    <p>The formal language of predicate logic consists of:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Variables:</strong> Typically denoted by lowercase letters (x, y, z, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Constants:</strong> Specific objects, often denoted by lowercase letters (a, b, c, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Function symbols:</strong> Represent functions from objects to objects (f, g, h, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Predicate symbols:</strong> Represent properties or relations (P, Q, R, etc.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Logical connectives:</strong> ¬ (not), ∧ (and), ∨ (or), → (implies), ↔ (if and only if)</li>
                        <li><strong>Quantifiers:</strong> ∀ (for all), ∃ (there exists)</li>
                        <li><strong>Parentheses:</strong> Used for grouping</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Terms and Formulas</h4>
                    <p><strong>Terms</strong> represent objects and are built from:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Variables</li>
                        <li>Constants</li>
                        <li>Functions applied to other terms</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p><strong>Formulas</strong> (or well-formed formulas, WFFs) are constructed according to the following rules:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If P is an n-ary predicate symbol and t₁, ..., tₙ are terms, then P(t₁, ..., tₙ) is a formula.</li>
                        <li>If φ is a formula, then ¬φ is a formula.</li>
                        <li>If φ and ψ are formulas, then (φ ∧ ψ), (φ ∨ ψ), (φ → ψ), and (φ ↔ ψ) are formulas.</li>
                        <li>If φ is a formula and x is a variable, then ∀x φ and ∃x φ are formulas.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Semantics: Interpretation and Models</h4>
                    <p>The meaning of formulas in predicate logic is given by interpretations or structures, which consist of:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>A non-empty set D (the domain or universe)</li>
                        <li>For each constant symbol, an element of D</li>
                        <li>For each n-ary function symbol, a function from Dⁿ to D</li>
                        <li>For each n-ary predicate symbol, a subset of Dⁿ (representing the tuples for which the predicate is true)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>A formula is <strong>satisfiable</strong> if there exists an interpretation under which it is true. A formula is <strong>valid</strong> (or a tautology) if it is true under all interpretations.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Interpretation in a Domain</div>
                        <p>Consider the formula: ∀x∃y R(x, y)</p>
                        <p>Let's interpret this in two different domains:</p>
                        <p>1. Domain: Set of integers, R(x, y) means "y > x"</p>
                        <p>This formula is true in this interpretation because for any integer x, we can always find another integer y that is greater than x (e.g., y = x + 1).</p>
                        <p>2. Domain: Set of natural numbers, R(x, y) means "y divides x"</p>
                        <p>This formula is true in this interpretation because for any natural number x, we can always find y = 1, which divides every natural number.</p>
                        <p>3. Domain: Set of natural numbers, R(x, y) means "x divides y"</p>
                        <p>This formula is false in this interpretation. For example, if x = 4, there is no natural number y such that 4 divides y, other than multiples of 4. So for x = 4, we would need ∃y such that 4 divides y, which means y must be 4, 8, 12, etc. But this doesn't work for all x (consider x = 0).</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Negation of Quantified Statements</h3>
                    
                    <p class="text-secondary">Understanding how to negate quantified statements is crucial for many mathematical proofs, especially when using proof by contradiction.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Negation Rules</h4>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        <p>¬(∀x P(x)) ≡ ∃x ¬P(x)</p>
                        <p>¬(∃x P(x)) ≡ ∀x ¬P(x)</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>In words:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>"It is not the case that all x have property P" is equivalent to "There exists an x that does not have property P."</li>
                        <li>"It is not the case that there exists an x with property P" is equivalent to "All x do not have property P."</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Multiple Quantifiers</h4>
                    <p>For statements with multiple quantifiers, negation is more complex. We negate the entire statement and then apply the negation rules to each quantifier from left to right, changing ∀ to ∃ and vice versa, and negating the matrix (the part after the quantifiers).</p>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Negating Multiple Quantifiers</div>
                        <p>Let's negate the statement: ∀x∃y(x + y = 0)</p>
                        <p>Step 1: Negate the entire statement: ¬(∀x∃y(x + y = 0))</p>
                        <p>Step 2: Apply the negation rule for ∀: ∃x¬(∃y(x + y = 0))</p>
                        <p>Step 3: Apply the negation rule for ∃: ∃x∀y¬(x + y = 0)</p>
                        <p>The final negation is: ∃x∀y(x + y ≠ 0)</p>
                        <p>In plain English, the original statement means "For every number x, there exists a number y such that x + y = 0" (which is true in the domain of real numbers, since y = -x works).</p>
                        <p>The negation means "There exists a number x such that for all numbers y, x + y ≠ 0" (which is false in the domain of real numbers, since for any x, we can choose y = -x to make x + y = 0).</p>

                    <h4>Inference Rules for Predicate Logic</h4>
                    <p>In addition to the inference rules from propositional logic, predicate logic has rules specifically for quantifiers:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Universal Instantiation (UI):</strong> From ∀x P(x), we can infer P(c) for any specific constant c in the domain.</p>
                    <p><strong>Existential Generalization (EG):</strong> From P(c) for some specific constant c, we can infer ∃x P(x).</p>
                    <p><strong>Universal Generalization (UG):</strong> If we can prove P(c) for an arbitrary constant c (with no special assumptions about c), then we can infer ∀x P(x).</p>
                    <p><strong>Existential Instantiation (EI):</strong> From ∃x P(x), we can infer P(c) for some new constant c that doesn't appear elsewhere in the proof.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Proof Techniques Using Predicate Logic</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>Direct Proof for Universal Statements:</strong> To prove ∀x P(x), assume x is arbitrary and prove P(x).</p>
                    <p><strong>Proof by Counterexample:</strong> To disprove ∀x P(x), find a specific value of x for which P(x) is false.</p>
                    <p><strong>Constructive Proof for Existential Statements:</strong> To prove ∃x P(x), find a specific value of x for which P(x) is true.</p>
                    <p><strong>Proof by Contradiction:</strong> To prove a statement S, assume ¬S and derive a contradiction.</p>

                        <p>2. By definition, Odd(n) means n = 2k + 1 for some integer k.</p>
                        <p>3. Therefore, n² = (2k + 1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1 = 2(2k² + 2k) + 1.</p>
                        <p>4. Let m = 2k² + 2k, which is an integer since k is an integer.</p>
                        <p>5. Then n² = 2m + 1, which means n² is odd by definition.</p>
                        <p>6. Since n was arbitrary, we have proven that for all integers n, if n is odd, then n² is odd.</p>

                    <p>First-order predicate logic can be extended in various ways:</p>
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Second-Order Logic:</strong> Allows quantification over predicates and functions, not just variables.</li>
                        <li><strong>Modal Logic:</strong> Adds operators for "necessity" (□) and "possibility" (◇).</li>
                        <li><strong>Temporal Logic:</strong> Adds operators for reasoning about time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Fuzzy Logic:</strong> Allows truth values between 0 and 1, not just true and false.</li>

                        <p>Here are some common mathematical concepts expressed in predicate logic:</p>
                        <p><strong>Injectivity (one-to-one):</strong> A function f is injective if ∀x∀y(f(x) = f(y) → x = y).</p>
                        <p><strong>Surjectivity (onto):</strong> A function f from A to B is surjective if ∀y∈B∃x∈A(f(x) = y).</p>
                        <p><strong>Limit of a sequence:</strong> L is the limit of sequence (aₙ) if:</p>
                        <p>∀ε > 0 ∃N ∀n > N (|aₙ - L| < ε)</p>
                        <p><strong>Continuity of a function:</strong> A function f is continuous at a point c if:</p>
                        <p>∀ε > 0 ∃δ > 0 ∀x (|x - c| < δ → |f(x) - f(c)| < ε)</p>
