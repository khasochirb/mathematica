                    <p class="text-secondary">Projective geometry is a branch of mathematics that studies geometric properties that remain invariant under projective transformations. Unlike Euclidean geometry, which focuses on properties like distance and angle, projective geometry concerns itself with properties like collinearity, cross-ratio, and incidence of points and lines.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-secondary">Projective geometry emerged from the study of perspective drawing during the Renaissance period, when artists wanted to accurately represent three-dimensional objects on a two-dimensional canvas. The mathematical foundations were developed by mathematicians like Girard Desargues (1591-1661) and Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788-1867).</p>
                    
                    <h4>Key Concepts</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Projective Plane</strong>: An extension of the Euclidean plane that includes "points at infinity" (also called ideal points)</li>
                        <li><strong>Projective Transformations</strong>: Mappings that preserve collinearity (points on a line remain on a line)</li>
                        <li><strong>Duality Principle</strong>: Statements about points and lines can be exchanged to produce new valid statements</li>
                        <li><strong>Cross-Ratio</strong>: A ratio that remains invariant under projective transformations</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p class="text-secondary">Projective geometry provides a more general framework than Euclidean geometry, in which parallel lines meet at "points at infinity" and many special cases of Euclidean geometry are unified.</p>

                <div class="topic-section edu-card">
                    <h3 class="topic-header">The Projective Plane</h3>
                    
                    <p>The projective plane extends the Euclidean plane by adding points at infinity. Intuitively, these points at infinity represent the directions in which parallel lines extend. In the projective plane, any two distinct lines meet at exactly one point, eliminating the need for the parallel postulate of Euclidean geometry.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Homogeneous Coordinates</h4>
                    <p>Points in the projective plane are represented using homogeneous coordinates, typically denoted as [x:y:z]. The key properties of homogeneous coordinates are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>A point [x:y:z] is the same as [λx:λy:λz] for any non-zero scalar λ</li>
                        <li>Points with z ≠ 0 correspond to the Euclidean point (x/z, y/z)</li>
                        <li>Points with z = 0 are the "points at infinity"</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Similarly, lines in the projective plane can be represented by homogeneous coordinates [a:b:c], which correspond to the line with equation ax + by + cz = 0.</p>
                    
                    <h4>The Line at Infinity</h4>
                    <p>The points with homogeneous coordinates [x:y:0] form the "line at infinity." This line contains all the points at infinity, which correspond to directions in the Euclidean plane. Parallel lines in the Euclidean plane meet at a point on the line at infinity in the projective plane.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Representing Points and Lines</div>
                        <p>The Euclidean point (3, 4) corresponds to the projective point [3:4:1], or equivalently [6:8:2], [9:12:3], etc.</p>
                        <p>The Euclidean line 2x + 3y = 6 can be written in homogeneous coordinates as 2x + 3y - 6z = 0, which is represented by the projective line [2:3:-6].</p>
                        <p>Two parallel Euclidean lines, say y = 2x + 1 and y = 2x + 3, meet at the point at infinity [1:2:0] in the projective plane.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Projective Transformations</h3>
                    
                    <p>A projective transformation (or projectivity) is a mapping that preserves collinearity—points that lie on a line are mapped to points that lie on a line. Projective transformations are represented by 3×3 non-singular matrices acting on homogeneous coordinates.</p>
                    
                    <p>If a point has homogeneous coordinates [x:y:z], then under a projective transformation represented by the matrix:</p>
                    
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        <p>T = [a b c]</p>
                        <p>    [d e f]</p>
                        <p>    [g h i]</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>The transformed point has coordinates:</p>
                    
                    <div class="math-formula">

                    </div>
                    
                    <h4>Types of Projective Transformations</h4>
                    <p>Special cases of projective transformations include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Perspective Transformations</strong>: Mappings from one plane to another through a center of projection</li>
                        <li><strong>Affine Transformations</strong>: Preserve parallelism and ratio of distances along a line</li>
                        <li><strong>Euclidean Transformations</strong>: Preserve distances and angles (isometries)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>These form a hierarchy, with Euclidean transformations being a subset of affine transformations, which in turn are a subset of projective transformations.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Projective Transformation</div>
                        <p>Consider the projective transformation of a traditional Mongolian ger pattern represented by the matrix:</p>
                        <p>T = [1 2 0]</p>
                        <p>    [0 1 0]</p>
                        <p>    [0 0 1]</p>
                        <p>To find how this transformation affects a point [3:4:1] in the pattern, we compute:</p>
                        <p>[3:4:1] → [1×3 + 2×4 + 0×1 : 0×3 + 1×4 + 0×1 : 0×3 + 0×4 + 1×1] = [11:4:1]</p>
                        <p>Converting back to Euclidean coordinates, the point (3, 4) in the original pattern is mapped to (11/1, 4/1) = (11, 4), showing how the traditional pattern transforms while maintaining its geometric properties.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Duality Principle</h3>
                    
                    <p>One of the most elegant features of projective geometry is the principle of duality, which states that any theorem about points and lines in the projective plane remains valid if we interchange the roles of "point" and "line."</p>
                    
                    <p>For instance, the statement "two distinct points determine a unique line" has the dual statement "two distinct lines determine a unique point."</p>
                    
                    <h4>Dual Elements</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The dual of a point [x:y:z] is the line [x:y:z]</li>
                        <li>The dual of a line [a:b:c] is the point [a:b:c]</li>
                        <li>The dual of "a point lies on a line" is "a line passes through a point"</li>
                        <li>The dual of "the line joining two points" is "the point of intersection of two lines"</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Examples of Dual Theorems</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Desargues' Theorem and its Dual</strong>: If two triangles are perspective from a point, then they are perspective from a line, and vice versa</li>
                        <li><strong>Pascal's Theorem and Brianchon's Theorem</strong>: These are dual theorems about hexagons inscribed in and circumscribed around a conic, respectively</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Duality in Action</div>
                        <p>Original statement: "Three points not on a line determine a unique triangle in a traditional Mongolian decorative pattern."</p>
                        <p>Dual statement: "Three lines not through a point determine a unique trilateral in a traditional Mongolian textile design."</p>
                        <p>Both statements are valid in projective geometry. This exemplifies how the duality principle allows us to derive new theorems about traditional Mongolian geometric patterns by simply exchanging the roles of points and lines.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Cross-Ratio and Projective Invariants</h3>
                    
                    <p>A fundamental concept in projective geometry is the cross-ratio, a quantity that remains invariant under projective transformations.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Cross-Ratio Definition</h4>
                    <p>Given four collinear points A, B, C, and D, the cross-ratio (A, B; C, D) is defined as:</p>
                    
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        <p>(A, B; C, D) = (AC/BC) ÷ (AD/BD)</p>

                    <p>where AC represents the directed distance from A to C, and so on.</p>
                    
                    <p>Alternatively, if the points have coordinates A = [x₁:y₁:z₁], B = [x₂:y₂:z₂], etc., the cross-ratio can be computed using determinants.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Properties of Cross-Ratio</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The cross-ratio is invariant under projective transformations</li>
                        <li>The 24 possible orderings of four points yield only six distinct cross-ratio values</li>
                        <li>If (A, B; C, D) = λ, then (A, B; D, C) = 1/λ, (B, A; C, D) = 1/λ, and (B, A; D, C) = λ</li>

                        <p>Given four collinear points in a traditional Mongolian decorative border with coordinates A = (1, 0), B = (3, 0), C = (5, 0), and D = (7, 0), find the cross-ratio (A, B; C, D).</p>
                        <p>Solution:</p>
                        <p>AC = 5 - 1 = 4, BC = 5 - 3 = 2</p>
                        <p>AD = 7 - 1 = 6, BD = 7 - 3 = 4</p>
                        <p>(A, B; C, D) = (AC/BC) ÷ (AD/BD) = (4/2) ÷ (6/4) = 2 ÷ 1.5 = 4/3</p>
                        <p>This cross-ratio remains unchanged if the four points in the decorative border undergo any projective transformation, preserving the pattern's geometric properties.</p>

                    <p>Conics (circles, ellipses, parabolas, and hyperbolas) play a special role in projective geometry. From a projective perspective, all non-degenerate conics are equivalent—a circle can be transformed into an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola through a suitable projective transformation.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Projective Definition of Conics</h4>
                    <p>A conic in the projective plane can be defined as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The locus of points P such that the cross-ratio (A, B; C, P) is constant, where A, B, and C are fixed points on a line, and the line varies through a fixed point O</li>
                        <li>The set of points satisfying a homogeneous quadratic equation: ax² + by² + cz² + dxy + exz + fyz = 0</li>
                        <li>The image of a circle under a projective transformation</li>

                    <h4>Pascal's Theorem</h4>
                    <p>Pascal's theorem states that if a hexagon is inscribed in a conic, then the three points of intersection of the opposite sides lie on a straight line (called the Pascal line).</p>
                    
                    <h4>Brianchon's Theorem</h4>
                    <p>The dual of Pascal's theorem, Brianchon's theorem states that if a hexagon is circumscribed around a conic, then the three diagonals connecting opposite vertices meet at a point (called the Brianchon point).</p>

                        <p>In Euclidean geometry, the equation x² + y² = 1 represents a circle, y = x² represents a parabola, and xy = 1 represents a hyperbola.</p>
                        <p>In projective geometry, we can homogenize these equations, which can represent various traditional Mongolian decorative elements:</p>
                        <p>Circle (like a traditional Mongolian bowl): x² + y² - z² = 0</p>
                        <p>Parabola (like a traditional Mongolian arch): y·z = x²</p>
                        <p>Hyperbola (like a traditional Mongolian decorative curve): x·y = z²</p>
                        <p>These can all be transformed into each other through projective transformations, illustrating that from a projective viewpoint, all non-degenerate conics are equivalent, just as different traditional Mongolian patterns can be transformed while maintaining their essential geometric properties.</p>

                    <h4>Perspective and Art</h4>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Projective geometry provides the mathematical foundation for perspective drawing in art. The vanishing points in a perspective drawing correspond to points at infinity in the projective plane.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Computer Graphics</h4>
                    <p>Projective transformations are fundamental in 3D computer graphics for rendering objects on a 2D screen. The mathematical formalism of homogeneous coordinates and perspective projections derives directly from projective geometry.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Computer Vision</h4>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Projective geometry is essential in computer vision for understanding how 3D scenes project onto 2D images, enabling tasks like camera calibration, 3D reconstruction, and image recognition.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Algebraic Geometry</h4>
                    <p>Projective space provides a natural setting for algebraic geometry, the study of geometric objects defined by polynomial equations. Working in projective space often simplifies the theory and eliminates special cases.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Non-Euclidean Geometries</h4>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Projective geometry serves as a unifying framework for different geometries, including Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries like hyperbolic and elliptic geometries.</p>

                        <div class="example-title">Example: Camera Model in Traditional Mongolian Art</div>
                        <p>In traditional Mongolian art and modern photography of cultural artifacts, the pinhole camera model is described using projective geometry. A 3D point (X, Y, Z) on a traditional Mongolian ger or artifact is projected onto a 2D image plane with coordinates (x, y) using the equation:</p>
                        <p>[x:y:1] = K[R|t][X:Y:Z:1]</p>
                        <p>where K is the camera's intrinsic matrix, and [R|t] is the extrinsic matrix describing the camera's position and orientation.</p>
                        <p>This elegant formulation, using homogeneous coordinates and projective transformations, encapsulates the geometry of capturing traditional Mongolian architectural and artistic elements in a concise way that would be much more cumbersome in purely Euclidean terms.</p>
