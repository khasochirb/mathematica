                    <h3 class="topic-header">Introduction to Euclidean Geometry</h3>
                    
                    <p class="text-secondary">Euclidean geometry is the study of geometry based on definitions, undefined terms (point, line and plane) and the axioms developed by the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid around 300 BCE in his work "Elements". This branch of mathematics has been fundamental to our understanding of space for over two millennia.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Basic Elements</h4>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Euclidean geometry is built upon:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Points</strong>: Objects with no dimension (zero-dimensional)</li>
                        <li><strong>Lines</strong>: One-dimensional objects that extend infinitely in both directions</li>
                        <li><strong>Planes</strong>: Two-dimensional flat surfaces that extend infinitely</li>
                        <li><strong>Angles</strong>: Formed by two rays with a common endpoint (vertex)</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Euclid's Five Postulates</h4>
                    <p>The foundation of Euclidean geometry rests on five postulates:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A straight line can be drawn between any two points.</li>
                        <li>Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.</li>
                        <li>Given a point and a distance, a circle can be drawn with the point as its center and the distance as its radius.</li>
                        <li>All right angles are equal to one another.</li>
                        <li>The parallel postulate: If a line crosses two other lines, and the interior angles on the same side add up to less than two right angles, then the two lines will eventually intersect on that side.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <p>The fifth postulate, also known as the parallel postulate, is particularly famous and led to the development of non-Euclidean geometries when mathematicians questioned its necessity.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Parallel Lines</div>
                        <p>Consider two parallel lines l₁ and l₂ crossed by a transversal t. According to the parallel postulate, the corresponding angles are equal, and the sum of interior angles on the same side of the transversal is 180°.</p>
                        <p>If angle A = 65° (one of the angles formed by line l₁ and transversal t), then:</p>
                        <p>The corresponding angle on line l₂ also equals 65°.</p>
                        <p>The interior angle adjacent to angle A on line l₁ is 115° (since 65° + 115° = 180°).</p>
                        <p>The interior angle on the same side of the transversal on line l₂ is also 115°.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Congruence</h3>
                    
                    <p>Two geometric figures are congruent if they have exactly the same size and shape. That is, one figure can be transformed into the other by a combination of translations, rotations, and reflections.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Congruence of Triangles</h4>
                    <p>Triangles can be proven congruent using the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>SSS (Side-Side-Side)</strong>: All three pairs of corresponding sides are equal.</li>
                        <li><strong>SAS (Side-Angle-Side)</strong>: Two pairs of corresponding sides and the included angle are equal.</li>
                        <li><strong>ASA (Angle-Side-Angle)</strong>: Two pairs of corresponding angles and the included side are equal.</li>
                        <li><strong>AAS (Angle-Angle-Side)</strong>: Two pairs of corresponding angles and a non-included side are equal.</li>
                        <li><strong>HL (Hypotenuse-Leg)</strong>: For right triangles, the hypotenuse and one leg are equal.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        <p>If △ABC ≅ △DEF, then:</p>
                        <p>AB = DE, BC = EF, AC = DF (corresponding sides)</p>
                        <p>∠A = ∠D, ∠B = ∠E, ∠C = ∠F (corresponding angles)</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Proving Triangle Congruence</div>
                        <p>Given triangles ABC and DEF with:</p>
                        <p>AB = 5 cm, BC = 7 cm, AC = 8 cm</p>
                        <p>DE = 5 cm, EF = 7 cm, DF = 8 cm</p>
                        <p>We can conclude that △ABC ≅ △DEF by the SSS congruence criterion.</p>
                        <p>This means that corresponding angles are also equal:</p>
                        <p>∠A = ∠D, ∠B = ∠E, and ∠C = ∠F</p>

                    <h4>Applications of Congruence</h4>
                    <p>Congruence is essential in many real-world applications:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Engineering and manufacturing to ensure parts fit together correctly</li>
                        <li>Construction to verify that structural elements have the required dimensions</li>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Similarity</h3>
                    
                    <p>Two geometric figures are similar if they have the same shape but not necessarily the same size. Formally, two figures are similar if there exists a sequence of transformations (rotation, reflection, translation) followed by a uniform scaling that maps one figure to the other.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Similarity of Triangles</h4>
                    <p>Triangles can be proven similar using the following criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>AAA (Angle-Angle-Angle)</strong>: All three pairs of corresponding angles are equal. (Note: Since the sum of angles in a triangle is 180°, it's sufficient to show that two pairs of angles are equal.)</li>
                        <li><strong>SSS (Side-Side-Side)</strong>: All corresponding sides are proportional.</li>
                        <li><strong>SAS (Side-Angle-Side)</strong>: Two pairs of corresponding sides are proportional, and the included angles are equal.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        <p>If △ABC ~ △DEF with scale factor k, then:</p>

                        <p>∠A = 50°, ∠B = 60°, ∠C = 70°</p>
                        <p>∠P = 50°, ∠Q = 60°, ∠R = 70°</p>
                        <p>We can conclude that △ABC ~ △PQR by the AAA similarity criterion.</p>
                        <p>If AB = 10 cm and PQ = 15 cm, then the scale factor is k = 15/10 = 1.5.</p>
                        <p>Therefore:</p>
                        <p>QR = 1.5·BC and PR = 1.5·AC</p>
                        <p>Area of △PQR = (1.5)²·(Area of △ABC) = 2.25·(Area of △ABC)</p>

                    <p>A circle is the set of all points in a plane that are at a fixed distance (radius) from a given point (center).</p>
                    
                    <h4>Basic Elements and Terminology</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Center</strong>: The point from which all points on the circle are equidistant</li>
                        <li><strong>Radius</strong>: The distance from the center to any point on the circle</li>
                        <li><strong>Diameter</strong>: A line segment passing through the center, connecting two points on the circle (twice the radius)</li>
                        <li><strong>Chord</strong>: A line segment connecting two points on the circle</li>
                        <li><strong>Arc</strong>: A portion of the circumference of a circle</li>

                    <h4>Circle Theorems</h4>
                    <p>Here are some important theorems about circles:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Angle at the Center</strong>: An angle at the center of a circle is twice the angle at the circumference subtended by the same arc.</li>
                        <li><strong>Angles in the Same Arc</strong>: Angles in the same segment of a circle are equal.</li>
                        <li><strong>Angle in a Semicircle</strong>: The angle in a semicircle is a right angle.</li>
                        <li><strong>Angles in Opposite Segments</strong>: Angles in opposite segments are supplementary (add up to 180°).</li>
                        <li><strong>Tangent-Radius Theorem</strong>: A tangent to a circle is perpendicular to the radius at the point of tangency.</li>
                        <li><strong>Power of a Point</strong>: If two chords AB and CD intersect at point P, then PA × PB = PC × PD.</li>
                        <li><strong>Tangent-Secant Theorem</strong>: If from an external point P, a tangent PT and a secant PAB are drawn to a circle, then PT² = PA × PB.</li>
                    </ol>

                        <p>According to the inscribed angle theorem: ∠AOB = 2·∠ACB</p>
                        <p>If ∠ACB = 35°, then the central angle ∠AOB = 2 × 35° = 70°.</p>

                    <p>Triangles have several important points known as centers, each defined by the intersection of special lines.</p>
                    
                    <h4>The Four Main Triangle Centers</h4>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Centroid</strong>: The point of intersection of the three medians (lines from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side). The centroid divides each median in a 2:1 ratio and is the center of mass of the triangle.</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Incenter</strong>: The point of intersection of the angle bisectors. It is equidistant from the three sides and is the center of the inscribed circle (a circle that touches all three sides of the triangle).</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Circumcenter</strong>: The point of intersection of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides. It is equidistant from the three vertices and is the center of the circumscribed circle (a circle that passes through all three vertices).</li>
                        
                        <li><strong>Orthocenter</strong>: The point of intersection of the three altitudes (perpendicular lines from each vertex to the opposite side or its extension).</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h4>Euler Line</h4>
                    <p>In any triangle, the centroid, orthocenter, and circumcenter are collinear (they lie on a straight line). This line is called the Euler line, named after Leonhard Euler.</p>
                    
                    <h4>The Nine-Point Circle</h4>
                    <p>For any triangle, there exists a circle (the nine-point circle) that passes through:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The midpoints of the three sides</li>
                        <li>The feet of the three altitudes</li>
                        <li>The midpoints of the segments from the orthocenter to each vertex</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The center of this circle lies on the Euler line, halfway between the orthocenter and the circumcenter.</p>

                        <div class="example-title">Example: Finding the Incenter</div>
                        <p>Consider triangle ABC with angles A = 60°, B = 50°, and C = 70°.</p>
                        <p>To find the incenter I, we need the angle bisectors.</p>
                        <p>The coordinates of the incenter can be calculated using the formula:</p>
                        <p>I = (a·A + b·B + c·C)/(a + b + c)</p>
                        <p>where a, b, and c are the side lengths, and A, B, and C are the vertex coordinates.</p>
                        <p>The distance from the incenter to any side equals the inradius r, which can be calculated as:</p>
                        <p>r = (Area of triangle)/(Semiperimeter) = Δ/s</p>
                        <p>where s = (a + b + c)/2 and Δ is the area of the triangle.</p>
