                    <p><strong>Diophantine equations</strong> are polynomial equations with integer coefficients for which integer solutions are sought. They are named after the ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus of Alexandria, who studied such equations in the 3rd century CE. Unlike general algebraic equations, Diophantine equations have the additional constraint that the solutions must be integers or rational numbers.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-secondary">Diophantine equations arise in various contexts, from pure mathematical problems like Fermat's Last Theorem to practical applications in cryptography, computer science, and discrete optimization. Solving these equations often requires techniques from number theory rather than standard calculus or algebra.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Classification of Diophantine Equations</h4>
                    <p class="text-secondary">Diophantine equations can be classified based on various criteria:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>By Degree:</strong> Linear, quadratic, cubic, or higher-degree equations.</li>
                        <li><strong>By Number of Variables:</strong> Binary (two variables), ternary (three variables), etc.</li>
                        <li><strong>By Form:</strong> Equations like Pell's equation (x² - Dy² = 1), Fermat's equation (x<sup>n</sup> + y<sup>n</sup> = z<sup>n</sup>), etc.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Solving Diophantine equations can be challenging. Some types have systematic solution methods, while others remain unsolved or have been proven to have no general algorithm for determining solutions (undecidable problems).</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Linear Diophantine Equations</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Basic Form and Existence of Solutions</h4>
                    <p>A <strong>linear Diophantine equation</strong> in two variables has the form:</p>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        ax + by = c
                    </div>
                    <p>where a, b, and c are integers, and we seek integer solutions for x and y.</p>
                    
                    <p>The fundamental theorem regarding linear Diophantine equations states that such an equation has integer solutions if and only if the greatest common divisor of a and b divides c. That is, solutions exist if and only if:</p>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        gcd(a, b) | c
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Existence of Solutions</div>
                        <p>Consider the equation 6x + 15y = 9:</p>
                        <p>gcd(6, 15) = 3</p>
                        <p>Since 3 divides 9, this equation has integer solutions.</p>
                        
                        <p>Now consider 4x + 6y = 5:</p>
                        <p>gcd(4, 6) = 2</p>
                        <p>Since 2 does not divide 5, this equation has no integer solutions.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h4>Finding Solutions using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm</h4>
                    <p>To find solutions to ax + by = c when gcd(a, b) | c, we use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Use the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find integers s and t such that as + bt = gcd(a, b).</li>
                        <li>Multiply both sides by c/gcd(a, b) to get a(s×c/gcd(a, b)) + b(t×c/gcd(a, b)) = c.</li>
                        <li>Therefore, x₀ = s×c/gcd(a, b) and y₀ = t×c/gcd(a, b) form a particular solution.</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Finding a Particular Solution</div>
                        <p>Solve 6x + 15y = 9:</p>
                        <p>First, find gcd(6, 15) using the Euclidean Algorithm:</p>
                        <p>15 = 6 × 2 + 3</p>
                        <p>6 = 3 × 2 + 0</p>
                        <p>So gcd(6, 15) = 3.</p>
                        
                        <p>Using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find s and t such that 6s + 15t = 3:</p>
                        <p>3 = 15 - 6 × 2</p>
                        <p>Therefore, s = -2 and t = 1.</p>
                        
                        <p>Multiplying by c/gcd(a, b) = 9/3 = 3:</p>
                        <p>6(-2×3) + 15(1×3) = 3×3</p>
                        <p>6(-6) + 15(3) = 9</p>
                        
                        <p>So, x₀ = -6 and y₀ = 3 is a particular solution.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <h4>General Solution</h4>
                    <p>If (x₀, y₀) is a particular solution to ax + by = c, then the general solution is given by:</p>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        x = x₀ + (b/d)t<br>
                        y = y₀ - (a/d)t
                    </div>
                    <p>where d = gcd(a, b) and t is an arbitrary integer.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: General Solution</div>
                        <p>For the equation 6x + 15y = 9, we found a particular solution x₀ = -6, y₀ = 3.</p>
                        <p>The general solution is:</p>
                        <p>x = -6 + (15/3)t = -6 + 5t</p>
                        <p>y = 3 - (6/3)t = 3 - 2t</p>
                        <p>where t is any integer.</p>
                        
                        <p>For t = 0: (x, y) = (-6, 3)</p>
                        <p>For t = 1: (x, y) = (-1, 1)</p>

                    <h4>Definition and Basic Properties</h4>
                    <p><strong>Pell's equation</strong> is a special type of quadratic Diophantine equation of the form:</p>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        x² - Dy² = 1
                    </div>
                    <p>where D is a positive integer that is not a perfect square, and we seek integer solutions for x and y.</p>
                    
                    <p>This equation is named after English mathematician John Pell, although it was actually studied extensively by Indian and European mathematicians, including Brahmagupta, Bhaskara II, and Fermat.</p>
                    
                    <p class="text-secondary">Key properties of Pell's equation:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For any non-square positive integer D, Pell's equation has infinitely many integer solutions.</li>

                        <li>Generate the convergents (approximations) of this continued fraction.</li>

                    </ol>

                        <p>The first few convergents are:</p>

                    <p>Several interesting properties of Pythagorean triples include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In a primitive Pythagorean triple, exactly one of a or b is odd, and the other is even. The hypotenuse c is always odd.</li>
                        <li>The area of the right-angled triangle with sides (a, b, c) is always ab/2, which is always an integer.</li>
                        <li>There are infinitely many primitive Pythagorean triples.</li>
                        <li>Non-primitive Pythagorean triples can be obtained by multiplying each element of a primitive triple by the same integer.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Fermat's Last Theorem</h4>
                    <p>Perhaps the most famous Diophantine equation is <strong>Fermat's Last Theorem</strong>, which states that there are no positive integer solutions to the equation:</p>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        x<sup>n</sup> + y<sup>n</sup> = z<sup>n</sup>
                    </div>
                    <p>for any integer n > 2.</p>
                    
                    <p>This theorem was conjectured by Pierre de Fermat in 1637 but remained unproven until Andrew Wiles provided a proof in 1994, over 350 years later. The proof is highly complex and draws on various areas of modern mathematics, including elliptic curves and modular forms.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Elliptic Curves</h4>
                    <p>An <strong>elliptic curve</strong> is a curve defined by an equation of the form:</p>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        y² = x³ + ax + b
                    </div>
                    <p>where a and b are constants. Finding rational or integer points on elliptic curves is a complex area of Diophantine equations with applications in cryptography and number theory.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Thue Equations</h4>
                    <p>A <strong>Thue equation</strong> is a homogeneous diophantine equation of the form:</p>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        f(x, y) = k
                    </div>
                    <p>where f is a homogeneous polynomial of degree ≥ 3 with integer coefficients, and k is a non-zero integer. Axel Thue proved in 1909 that such equations have only finitely many solutions in integers, a landmark result in Diophantine analysis.</p>

                        <p>The <strong>Coin Problem</strong> (or Frobenius coin problem) asks: Given coin denominations a₁, a₂, ..., a<sub>n</sub>, what is the largest amount that cannot be made using these coins?</p>
                        <p>This is equivalent to finding the largest integer that is not expressible as a non-negative linear combination of the given integers:</p>

                            a₁x₁ + a₂x₂ + ... + a<sub>n</sub>x<sub>n</sub> = m

                        <p>For n = 2, if gcd(a₁, a₂) = 1, the answer is a₁a₂ - a₁ - a₂.</p>
                        <p>For example, with coins of denominations 3 and 5, the largest amount that cannot be made is 3×5 - 3 - 5 = 15 - 8 = 7.</p>
