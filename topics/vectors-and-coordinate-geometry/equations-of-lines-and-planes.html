                    <p>Lines and planes are fundamental geometric objects that can be described algebraically using equations. These equations allow us to analyze their properties, determine their positions in space, and calculate their intersections. Understanding the various forms of these equations is essential for solving problems in three-dimensional geometry, computer graphics, robotics, and many scientific fields.</p>
                    
                    <p>This page explores the different ways to represent lines and planes mathematically, with a focus on vector equations and parametric representations.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Historical Context</div>
                        <p>The study of lines and planes has ancient origins, but the modern algebraic treatment emerged with René Descartes's development of coordinate geometry in the 17th century. The vector approach to representing lines and planes became prominent in the 19th and early 20th centuries, particularly through the work of mathematicians like Hermann Grassmann, William Rowan Hamilton, and Josiah Willard Gibbs. This vector approach has proven especially powerful for dealing with objects in three-dimensional space and beyond.</p>

                    <p>A line in two-dimensional space can be represented in several ways:</p>
                    
                    <h4>1. Slope-Intercept Form</h4>
                    <div class="math-formula">

                    <p>where m is the slope of the line and b is the y-intercept.</p>

                    <div class="math-formula">
                        y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)
                    </div>
                    <p>where (x₁, y₁) is a point on the line and m is the slope.</p>
                    
                    <h4>3. Two-Point Form</h4>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        y - y₁ = ((y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁))(x - x₁)
                    </div>
                    <p>where (x₁, y₁) and (x₂, y₂) are two distinct points on the line.</p>
                    
                    <h4>4. General Form (Standard Form)</h4>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        Ax + By + C = 0

                    <h4>5. Intercept Form</h4>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        x/a + y/b = 1

                    <p>where a is the x-intercept and b is the y-intercept.</p>

                        <p>y - 3 = ((9 - 3)/(4 - 1))(x - 1)</p>
                        <p>y - 3 = (6/3)(x - 1)</p>
                        <p>y - 3 = 2(x - 1)</p>
                        <p>y - 3 = 2x - 2</p>

                        <p>From y = 2x + 1, we get:</p>

                        <p>If x = 0: y = 2(0) + 1 = 1</p>
                        <p>Therefore: x/(-1/2) + y/1 = 1</p>

                    <p>where (x₀, y₀, z₀) is a point on the line, (a, b, c) is a direction vector of the line, and t is the parameter.</p>
                    
                    <h4>2. Vector Equation of a Line</h4>

                    <h4>3. Symmetric Equations of a Line</h4>
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        (x - x₀)/a = (y - y₀)/b = (z - z₀)/c

                    <p>A line in 3D space can also be represented as the intersection of two planes:</p>

                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                        <p>The parametric equations of the line are:</p>
                        <p>x = 1 + 2t</p>

                        <p>z = 3 + t</p>
                        <p>Substituting into the plane equation:</p>
                        <p>2(1 + 2t) + 3(2) - (3 + t) + 4 = 0</p>
                        <p>2 + 4t + 6 - 3 - t + 4 = 0</p>

                        <p>t = -3</p>
                        <p>Now we substitute t = -3 back into the parametric equations:</p>
                        <p>x = 1 + 2(-3) = 1 - 6 = -5</p>
                        <p>y = 2</p>
                        <p>z = 3 + (-3) = 0</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the intersection point is (-5, 2, 0).</p>

                        <p>A light ray with direction vector v = (1, -1, 2) hits a reflective surface with normal vector n = (0, 0, 1). Find the direction vector of the reflected ray.</p>
                        <p><strong>Solution:</strong></p>
                        <p>We need to normalize both vectors:</p>
                        <p>|v| = √(1² + (-1)² + 2²) = √(1 + 1 + 4) = √6</p>
                        <p>v̂ = v/|v| = (1, -1, 2)/√6 ≈ (0.41, -0.41, 0.82)</p>
                        <p>|n| = √(0² + 0² + 1²) = 1</p>
                        <p>n̂ = n/|n| = (0, 0, 1)</p>
                        <p>The reflected ray direction is given by:</p>
                        <p>r = v̂ - 2(v̂·n̂)n̂</p>
                        <p>v̂·n̂ = (0.41 × 0) + (-0.41 × 0) + (0.82 × 1) = 0.82</p>
                        <p>r = (0.41, -0.41, 0.82) - 2(0.82)(0, 0, 1)</p>
                        <p>r = (0.41, -0.41, 0.82) - (0, 0, 1.64)</p>
                        <p>r = (0.41, -0.41, -0.82)</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the direction vector of the reflected ray is approximately (0.41, -0.41, -0.82), which has the same x and y components as the incident ray but the opposite z component.</p>
