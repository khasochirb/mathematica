                    <p>A tree is a special type of graph that has numerous applications across various fields, including computer science, network design, biology, and linguistics. Trees are fundamentally important in graph theory and algorithm design due to their unique properties that make them both simple to understand and powerful to use.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Definition of a Tree</h4>
                    <p>A tree is an undirected graph that satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is connected and has no cycles.</li>
                        <li>It is acyclic, and adding any edge creates exactly one cycle.</li>
                        <li>It is connected, and removing any edge creates exactly two disconnected components.</li>
                        <li>There is exactly one simple path between any two vertices.</li>
                        <li>It is connected and has exactly n-1 edges, where n is the number of vertices.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>Basic Terminology</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Root</strong>: In a rooted tree, a designated vertex from which the tree is viewed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Parent</strong>: The vertex connected to a given vertex on the path toward the root.</li>
                        <li><strong>Child</strong>: A vertex connected to a given vertex on the path away from the root.</li>
                        <li><strong>Siblings</strong>: Vertices that share the same parent.</li>
                        <li><strong>Ancestor</strong>: Any vertex on the path from a given vertex to the root.</li>
                        <li><strong>Descendant</strong>: Any vertex for which a given vertex is an ancestor.</li>
                        <li><strong>Leaf</strong>: A vertex with no children (degree 1 in the tree).</li>
                        <li><strong>Internal Vertex</strong>: A non-leaf vertex.</li>
                        <li><strong>Level</strong>: The number of edges on the path from a vertex to the root.</li>
                        <li><strong>Height</strong>: The maximum level of any vertex in the tree.</li>
                        <li><strong>Subtree</strong>: A tree formed by a vertex and all its descendants.</li>
                    </ul>

                            <li>Graph 2 has 4 vertices and 4 edges (> 4-1). It contains a cycle (A-B-C-D-A). Therefore, Graph 2 is not a tree.</li>
                            <li>Graph 3 has 5 vertices and 4 edges (= 5-1). It is connected and has no cycles. Therefore, Graph 3 is a tree.</li>

                    <h4>1. Rooted Trees</h4>
                    <p>A rooted tree is a tree where one vertex has been designated as the root. Once a root is defined, a parent-child relationship is established between adjacent vertices. Rooted trees can be further categorized based on constraints on the number of children or the organization of nodes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Binary Tree</strong>: A rooted tree where each node has at most two children, typically referred to as the left child and the right child.</li>
                        <li><strong>Full Binary Tree</strong>: A binary tree where every node has either 0 or 2 children.</li>
                        <li><strong>Complete Binary Tree</strong>: A binary tree where all levels are completely filled except possibly the lowest level, which is filled from left to right.</li>
                        <li><strong>Perfect Binary Tree</strong>: A binary tree where all internal nodes have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.</li>
                        <li><strong>Balanced Tree</strong>: A tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most a specified amount (usually 1).</li>
                        <li><strong>B-Tree</strong>: A self-balancing tree with more than two children per node, designed to work efficiently on disk storage.</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h4>2. Free Trees</h4>
                    <p>A free tree is a tree without a designated root. Any vertex can be considered as the root, changing the parent-child relationships accordingly.</p>
                    
                    <h4>3. Ordered Trees</h4>
                    <p>An ordered tree is a rooted tree in which the children of each node are ordered, typically from left to right.</p>
                    
                    <h4>4. Labeled Trees</h4>
                    <p>A labeled tree is a tree in which each vertex is assigned a unique label or value.</p>

                            <li>All nodes in the left subtree have values less than the node's value.</li>
                            <li>All nodes in the right subtree have values greater than the node's value.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>This is a valid BST because:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>For node 8: All nodes in the left subtree (3, 1, 6, 4, 7) have values less than 8, and all nodes in the right subtree (10, 14, 13) have values greater than 8.</li>
                            <li>For node 3: All nodes in the left subtree (1) have values less than 3, and all nodes in the right subtree (6, 4, 7) have values greater than 3.</li>
                            <li>And so on for all other nodes.</li>

                    <p>A spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph G is a tree that includes all the vertices of G with the minimum possible number of edges. In other words, a spanning tree is a subgraph of G that is a tree and spans (includes) all vertices of G.</p>

                    </ul>

                    <h4>Definition</h4>
                    <p>In a weighted undirected graph, a minimum spanning tree (MST) is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is minimized. In other words, an MST is a subset of the edges that forms a tree that includes every vertex, where the total weight of all the edges in the tree is minimized.</p>
                    
                    <p>If all edge weights are distinct, the MST is unique. Otherwise, there may be multiple MSTs with the same total weight.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Algorithms for Finding MSTs</h4>
                    <p>Several algorithms exist for finding MSTs efficiently:</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>1. Kruskal's Algorithm</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of their weight.</li>
                        <li>Initialize an empty MST.</li>
                        <li>Iterate through the sorted edges. For each edge:
                            <ul>
                                <li>If including this edge doesn't create a cycle in the MST, add it to the MST.</li>
                                <li>Otherwise, discard this edge.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>Continue until the MST has n-1 edges (where n is the number of vertices).</li>
                    </ol>

                        <li><strong>Cut Property</strong>: For any cut in the graph, if the edge with the minimum weight across the cut is not in the MST, then we can add it to the MST and remove another edge from the created cycle to obtain a spanning tree with smaller weight.</li>
