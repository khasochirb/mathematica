                    <p>The Pigeonhole Principle, also known as the Dirichlet box principle, is a simple yet powerful mathematical concept used to prove the existence of certain patterns or properties without directly constructing them.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Statement of the Principle</h4>
                    <p>The basic form of the pigeonhole principle states:</p>
                    
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        <p>If n pigeons are placed into m pigeonholes, and n > m, then at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>More precisely, at least one pigeonhole must contain at least ⌈n/m⌉ pigeons, where ⌈x⌉ represents the ceiling function (the smallest integer greater than or equal to x).</p>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Basic Pigeonhole Principle</div>
                        <p>In a traditional Mongolian wrestling tournament with 13 wrestlers, at least 2 wrestlers must have the same number of wins (assuming each wrestler has at least one win).</p>
                        <p>Proof:</p>
                        <p>If each wrestler has at least one win, the number of wins for each wrestler must be between 1 and 12 (since there are 13 wrestlers, a wrestler can't have more wins than there are other wrestlers).</p>
                        <p>We have 13 wrestlers (pigeons) and 12 possible numbers of wins (pigeonholes: 1 through 12).</p>
                        <p>By the pigeonhole principle, at least 2 wrestlers must have the same number of wins.</p>

                        <p>There are 2 colors (pigeonholes), and we need to ensure we have at least 2 socks of the same color. By the pigeonhole principle, we need to take at least 2 + 1 = 3 socks to guarantee a matching pair.</p>
                        <p>With 3 socks, even in the worst case (1 blue sock and 1 black sock initially), the third sock must match one of the first two.</p>

                        <p>When dividing by 6, there are 6 possible remainders: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (pigeonholes).</p>

                        <p>Proof:</p>
                        <p>If we distribute 10 horses among 3 heats, and no heat has 4 or more horses, then each heat has at most 3 horses.</p>

                    <h4>Number Theory</h4>
                    <p>The pigeonhole principle is often used in number theory to prove the existence of certain numbers with specific properties.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Decimal Representation</div>
                        <p>Prove that a fraction a/b, where a and b are coprime positive integers, has a repeating decimal expansion if and only if b has a prime factorization containing only 2s and 5s.</p>
                        <p>When computing a/b as a decimal, we continually multiply the remainder by 10 and take the integer part as the next digit.</p>
                        <p>Since the remainder is always between 0 and b-1, there are only b possible remainders.</p>
                        <p>By the pigeonhole principle, if we calculate more than b digits, we must encounter the same remainder twice, which causes the decimal expansion to repeat from that point.</p>
                        <p>The only fractions that don't produce a repeating decimal are those where b is a divisor of some power of 10, which means b can only have prime factors of 2 and 5.</p>
                    </div>

                        <p>In a musical performance, if 8 musicians play notes from a scale of 7 notes, at least 2 musicians must play the same note at some point.</p>
                        <p>Proof:</p>
                        <p>Consider the sequence of notes played by each musician as a sequence of integers from 1 to 7.</p>
                        <p>If we look at the first 8 notes played (one from each musician), we have 8 integers (pigeons) and 7 possible values (pigeonholes).</p>
                        <p>By the pigeonhole principle, at least 2 musicians must play the same note.</p>

                    <h4>Ramsey Theory</h4>
                    <p>The pigeonhole principle is fundamental to Ramsey theory, which studies the conditions under which order must appear in disordered structures.</p>

                        <p>Represent people as vertices and relationships as edges in a graph, where an edge can be either "acquaintance" (blue) or "stranger" (red).</p>
                        <p>Consider any person at the party. There are 5 other people, each with a relationship to our selected person.</p>
                        <p>By the pigeonhole principle, at least 3 of these relationships must be of the same type (either all "acquaintance" or all "stranger").</p>
                        <p>Let's assume 3 people are acquaintances of our selected person. If any 2 of these 3 people are acquaintances of each other, then together with our selected person, they form a group of 3 mutual acquaintances.</p>
                        <p>If none of these 3 people are acquaintances of each other, then they form a group of 3 mutual strangers.</p>
                        <p>A similar argument works if 3 people are strangers to our selected person.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, there must exist either 3 mutual acquaintances or 3 mutual strangers.</p>

                        <p>Proof:</p>
                        <p>There are 4 suits in a deck (pigeonholes) and 5 cards drawn (pigeons).</p>
                        <p>By the pigeonhole principle, at least ⌈5/4⌉ = 2 cards must be of the same suit.</p>

                    <h4>Hashing</h4>
                    <p>The pigeonhole principle explains why collisions are inevitable in hash functions when the input domain is larger than the output range.</p>

                        <p>A hash function maps arbitrary-sized inputs to fixed-size outputs. If the input space exceeds the output space, show that collisions must exist.</p>
                        <p>Let's say we have a hash function h that maps inputs from a set S to outputs in a set T, where |S| > |T|.</p>
                        <p>By the pigeonhole principle, if we hash more than |T| distinct inputs, at least two inputs must hash to the same output value.</p>
                        <p>This is why all practical hash functions have collisions, and why hash table implementations must handle collisions.</p>

                    <p>The pigeonhole principle appears in many common situations, often where we need to prove something must happen without specifying exactly when or how.</p>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Identical Hairs</div>
                        <p>The average human head has about 100,000 hairs, while hair colors are typically classified into a few dozen shades. By the pigeonhole principle, many hairs on a person's head must be of identical color.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Calendar Events</div>
                        <p>If a person schedules 366 different events over the course of a year, prove that at least 2 events must occur on the same day.</p>
                        <p>Even in a leap year, there are at most 366 days. With 366 events and 366 days, each day could contain exactly one event.</p>
                        <p>However, with 367 events, by the pigeonhole principle, at least one day must contain at least 2 events.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Matching Birthdays</div>
                        <p>In a room of 23 people, what is the probability that at least 2 people share the same birthday (ignoring leap years)?</p>
                        <p>This is not directly a pigeonhole principle problem since we have 23 people and 365 days, but it illustrates how the principle applies to probability.</p>
                        <p>The probability that all 23 people have different birthdays is:
                        <br>P(all different) = (365/365) × (364/365) × ... × (343/365) ≈ 0.493</p>
                        <p>Therefore, the probability that at least 2 people share a birthday is:
                        <br>P(at least one match) = 1 - P(all different) ≈ 1 - 0.493 = 0.507 or about 50.7%</p>
                        <p>This result is surprisingly high, which shows the power of the pigeonhole principle in real-world scenarios.</p>
