                    <p>Chebyshev's inequality (also spelled Tchebychev or Chebyshov) is one of the most important results in probability theory and statistics. Named after the Russian mathematician Pafnuty Chebyshev, who first stated it in 1867, this inequality provides a bound on the probability that a random variable deviates from its expected value by more than a certain amount.</p>
                    
                    <p>The power of Chebyshev's inequality lies in its generality—it applies to any probability distribution with a finite variance, without requiring any knowledge of the specific form of the distribution. This makes it an invaluable tool across various fields, including statistics, machine learning, signal processing, and engineering.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Historical Context</h4>
                    <p>Pafnuty Lvovich Chebyshev (1821-1894) was a prominent Russian mathematician who made significant contributions to probability theory, statistics, and number theory. His work laid the foundations for modern probability theory, and his inequality became a cornerstone of the field.</p>
                    
                    <p>Chebyshev's inequality emerged from his work on the law of large numbers, which he was the first to prove in a general form. It represents a significant step in the development of statistical theory, providing a way to quantify the reliability of statistical estimates without assuming specific probability distributions.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic-header">Statement and Forms of Chebyshev's Inequality</h3>
                    
                    <h4>Basic Form</h4>
                    <p>For a random variable X with finite mean μ and finite variance σ², Chebyshev's inequality states that for any real number k > 0:</p>
                    
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        <p>P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k²</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>where:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) is the probability that X deviates from its mean μ by k or more standard deviations σ</li>
                        <li>k is any positive real number</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Equivalently, this can be written as:</p>
                    
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        <p>P(|X - μ| < kσ) > 1 - 1/k²</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>which gives a lower bound on the probability that X lies within k standard deviations of its mean.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Alternative Forms</h4>
                    
                    <p><strong>1. For any Positive Value ε</strong></p>
                    <p>An alternative formulation states that for any ε > 0:</p>
                    
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        <p>P(|X - μ| ≥ ε) ≤ σ²/ε²</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p><strong>2. For the Sample Mean</strong></p>
                    <p>Let X₁, X₂, ..., Xₙ be independent random variables with the same mean μ and variance σ², and let X̄ₙ be their sample mean. Then:</p>
                    
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        <p>P(|X̄ₙ - μ| ≥ ε) ≤ σ²/(nε²)</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>This is important in the proof of the weak law of large numbers.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>3. One-Sided Version</strong></p>
                    <p>There is also a one-sided version of Chebyshev's inequality:</p>
                    
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        <p>P(X - μ ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/(1+k²)</p>
                        <p>P(X - μ ≤ -kσ) ≤ 1/(1+k²)</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Applying Chebyshev's Inequality</div>
                        <p>Consider a random variable X with mean μ = 10 and standard deviation σ = 2. Chebyshev's inequality allows us to bound the probability that X deviates significantly from its mean:</p>
                        <p>For k = 2:</p>
                        <p>P(|X - 10| ≥ 2 × 2) = P(|X - 10| ≥ 4) ≤ 1/2² = 1/4 = 0.25</p>
                        <p>This means the probability that X is less than 6 or greater than 14 is at most 0.25, or equivalently, the probability that X is between 6 and 14 is at least 0.75.</p>
                        <p>For k = 3:</p>
                        <p>P(|X - 10| ≥ 3 × 2) = P(|X - 10| ≥ 6) ≤ 1/3² = 1/9 ≈ 0.111</p>
                        <p>So, the probability that X falls outside the range [4, 16] is at most about 11.1%.</p>

                    <h4>Markov's Inequality: A Building Block</h4>
                    <p>The proof of Chebyshev's inequality relies on Markov's inequality, which states that for a non-negative random variable Y and any positive value a:</p>
                    
                    <div class="math-formula">
                        <p>P(Y ≥ a) ≤ E[Y]/a</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <p>where E[Y] is the expected value of Y.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Proof Using Markov's Inequality</h4>
                    <p>To prove Chebyshev's inequality:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Define a new random variable Y = (X - μ)², which is non-negative.</li>
                        <li>The expected value of Y is E[Y] = E[(X - μ)²] = σ², which is the variance of X.</li>
                        <li>Now, P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) = P((X - μ)² ≥ k²σ²) = P(Y ≥ k²σ²).</li>
                        <li>Applying Markov's inequality to Y:
                            <div class="math-formula">
                                <p>P(Y ≥ k²σ²) ≤ E[Y]/(k²σ²) = σ²/(k²σ²) = 1/k²</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>Therefore, P(|X - μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k²</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <h4>Direct Proof</h4>
                    <p>Another approach is to use the definition of expectation and variance:</p>
                    
                    <ol>
                        <li>Consider the indicator function I_{|X-μ|≥kσ}, which equals 1 when |X-μ| ≥ kσ and 0 otherwise.</li>
                        <li>Note that if |X-μ| ≥ kσ, then (X-μ)² ≥ k²σ².</li>
                        <li>Thus, (X-μ)² ≥ k²σ² · I_{|X-μ|≥kσ}</li>
                        <li>Taking expectations:
                            <div class="math-formula">
                                <p>σ² = E[(X-μ)²] ≥ E[k²σ² · I_{|X-μ|≥kσ}] = k²σ² · P(|X-μ| ≥ kσ)</p>
                            </div>
                        </li>
                        <li>Dividing both sides by k²σ² yields P(|X-μ| ≥ kσ) ≤ 1/k²</li>
                    </ol>
                    
                    <div class="example">
                        <div class="example-title">Example: Proof for a Specific Distribution</div>
                        <p>Let's verify Chebyshev's inequality for a uniform distribution on [0, 1]. For this distribution:</p>
                        <p>Mean μ = 1/2</p>
                        <p>Variance σ² = 1/12</p>
                        <p>Standard deviation σ = 1/√12 ≈ 0.289</p>
                        <p>For k = 1, Chebyshev's inequality states:</p>
                        <p>P(|X - 1/2| ≥ 0.289) ≤ 1/1² = 1</p>
                        <p>This bound is trivial. For k = 2:</p>
                        <p>P(|X - 1/2| ≥ 2 × 0.289) = P(|X - 1/2| ≥ 0.578) ≤ 1/4 = 0.25</p>
                        <p>Since the range of X is [0, 1], the actual probability is P(X ≤ 0.5 - 0.578 or X ≥ 0.5 + 0.578) = P(X ≤ -0.078 or X ≥ 1.078) = 0, as these values are outside the range of X.</p>
                        <p>This example illustrates that Chebyshev's inequality provides an upper bound, which may not be tight for specific distributions.</p>

                        <p>Camp-Meidell bound: P(|X| ≥ 2) ≤ 4/(9×2²) ≈ 0.111</p>
